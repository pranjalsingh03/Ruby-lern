# OPERATORS

Ruby supports a rich set of operators, as you would expect from a modern language . Most operators are actually method calls.
For Example , a+b is intrepeted as a+(b), where the + method in the object referred to by variable a is 
called with b as its argument.

For each operator (+ - * / % ** & | ^ << >> && ||), there is a corresponding form of abbreviated assignment operator (+= -= etc.).
